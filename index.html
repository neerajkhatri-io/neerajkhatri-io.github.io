      <h2>How I Think</h2>
      <p>
        I approach problems through the lens of user empathy, constraints, and long-term leverage.
        My background in engineering has shaped how I reason about systems, trade-offs, and adoption —
        and how I use automation and AI to reduce repetitive thinking and cognitive load.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am particularly interested in problems where clarity, trust, and decision-making
        matter more than speed or surface-level optimisation.
      </p>
