  <h2>How I Think</h2>
  <p>
    I approach problems through the lens of user empathy, constraints, and long-term leverage.
    My background in engineering shapes how I reason about systems, trade-offs, and adoption —
    and how I use automation and AI to reduce repetitive thinking and cognitive load.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am particularly interested in problems where clarity, trust, and decision-making
    matter more than speed or surface-level optimisation.

        Late design changes often arrive under time pressure, with incomplete information
        and competing stakeholder priorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        This case explores how structured decision logic and AI-assisted signals
        can help teams assess impact, risk, and urgency — without replacing expert judgment.

      <p>
        In growing organisations, training and capability decisions are often made ad-hoc,
        driven by individual judgment rather than structured logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        I designed a Python-based decision system that classified skills, roles,
        and proficiency levels to surface training needs consistently and at scale.

        Meal planning is often framed as a productivity problem,
        but in reality it is an emotional and cognitive load problem.
